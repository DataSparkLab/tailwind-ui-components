### Installing via NPM

As a NPM package make sure that you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

1. Install Tailgrids as a dependency using NPM by running the command below:

```
npm i tailgrids
```

2. Require Tailgrids as a plugin inside the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```
module.exports = {
  //... other config of your project

  plugins: [
    require('tailgrids/plugin')
  ]

}
```

### With CDN

Opting for CDN installation is cautioned against due to potential limitations and performance concerns. However, if you wish to quickly experiment with TailGrids HTML components without the overhead of a full project setup, you can utilize CDN resources. Here's a streamlined process:

#### Step 1: Integration of Scripts and Stylesheets

Within the `<head>` tag of your HTML file, insert the following lines:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailgrids@2.1.0/plugin.min.js"></script>
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailgrids@2.1.0/assets/css/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Ensure to also include the CDN URLs for Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js in your code:

```
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
```

#### Step 2: Incorporating TailGrids Components

You can directly paste TailGrids HTML component code snippets into your project.

#### Important Notes:

1. **Limited Functionality:** Utilizing the CDN may result in certain components, especially those with dark mode support, functioning suboptimally.

2. **Troubleshooting:** In case of unexpected behavior, reference the official Tailwind CSS Dark Mode documentation for guidance.

3. **Production:** While suitable for experimentation, CDNs are generally discouraged for production environments due to potential drawbacks in performance and reliability.
